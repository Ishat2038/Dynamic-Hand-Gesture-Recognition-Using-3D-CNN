# Dynamic-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-3D-CNN
This project presents a custom-built 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) model for dynamic hand gesture recognition, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained on preprocessed gesture video frames and achieved 100% accuracy on the validation set.
