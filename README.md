# Dynamic-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-3D-CNN
This project presents a custom-built 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) model for dynamic hand gesture recognition, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained on preprocessed gesture video frames and achieved satisfactory accuracy.

Key Features:
Custom 3D-CNN architecture designed for temporal gesture data

Model training and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras

Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Visualization tools:

Accuracy/loss training graphs

Confusion matrix

Classification report

The final trained model was saved and can be reused for inference or further experimentation.
